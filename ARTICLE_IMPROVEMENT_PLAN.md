## 💡 Cross-Linking Strategy

Create a knowledge graph by linking articles:
- **Foundation articles** (1-5, 15) reference each other heavily
- **Deep-dive articles** (6-10) link back to foundations
- **Quick insights** (11-14) serve as entry points, link to deeper material
- Use consistent terminology across all articles (define in systems-thinking-primer.md)

Example link structure:
```markdown
See [AI Power Concentration](ai-power-concentration.md) for how this dynamic plays out in AI development,
and [Moloch Dynamics](moloch-dynamics-coordination-failures.md) for the game-theoretic mechanisms.
```
