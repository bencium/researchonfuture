# The Energy-Information-Coordination Framework
## A Simple Model for Understanding Civilizational Eras

### The Three Axes of Change

Throughout human history, major transitions can be understood through three fundamental dimensions:

1. **Energy**: How much power can we harness per person?
2. **Information**: How fast can ideas travel?
3. **Coordination**: How many people can align on shared goals?

These aren't just metrics—they're the substrate that determines what's possible in any given era.

### The Energy Axis

| Era | Energy Source | Per-Capita Power |
|-----|---------------|------------------|
| Hunter-gatherer | Fire, muscle | ~100W |
| Agricultural | Animals, water/wind | ~500W |
| Industrial | Coal, oil | ~5,000W |
| Digital | Electricity, silicon | ~10,000W |
| AI Era | Nuclear, solar, compute | ~50,000W+ |

**Key insight**: More energy per person = more degrees of freedom. You can feed more people with less labor, freeing cognitive bandwidth for specialization, innovation, and cultural complexity.

**Current status**: We're hitting energy constraints (climate, resource limits) just as compute demands explode. This tension shapes the next decade.

### The Information Axis

| Era | Medium | Speed | Reach |
|-----|--------|-------|-------|
| Oral | Speech, memory | Real-time, local | ~150 people (Dunbar) |
| Writing | Clay, papyrus, paper | Days to years | Thousands |
| Printing | Books, pamphlets | Weeks to months | Millions |
| Broadcast | Radio, TV | Near real-time | Billions |
| Internet | Digital networks | Milliseconds | Billions |
| LLMs | AI models | Instant, personalized | Billions, customized |

**Key insight**: Information speed and reach determine coordination ceiling. Writing enabled empires. Printing enabled revolutions. Internet enabled global real-time swarms.

**Current status**: We've gone from information scarcity (pre-internet) to information flooding (post-social media). The bottleneck shifted from access to **curation, verification, and sense-making**.

### The Coordination Axis

| Era | Coordination Mechanism | Max Group Size | Decision Speed |
|-----|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Tribal | Face-to-face, kinship | ~150 | Hours to days |
| Kingdoms | Hierarchy, religion | Thousands | Weeks to months |
| Nation-States | Bureaucracy, law | Millions | Months to years |
| Platforms | Algorithms, markets | Billions | Seconds to hours |
| Protocols | Code, smart contracts | Billions | Milliseconds |

**Key insight**: Coordination mechanisms are **stacked**, not replaced. You still have tribes (friend groups), hierarchies (corporations), nation-states (governments), platforms (Twitter), and protocols (Bitcoin) all operating simultaneously.

**Current status**: We're transitioning from **institution-centric** (governments, churches, old corporations) to **system-centric** (algorithms, markets, code, standards). Power is migrating from visible hierarchies to invisible systems.

### Using the Framework: Where Are We Now?

**Energy**: Constrained growth, climate pressure, nuclear/solar renaissance pending
**Information**: Flooded, personalized, increasingly AI-generated, verification crisis
**Coordination**: Substrate shift in progress, institutional trust declining, algorithmic/protocol trust quietly rising

This combo creates the distinct feeling of our current moment:
- **More capable individually** (anyone can publish, trade, build, reach millions)
- **Less coherent collectively** (no shared reality, fragmented narratives, coordination failures)

### Diagnostic Questions

Use this framework to analyze any moment in history or predict near-term futures:

1. **What's the energy bottleneck?** (If energy is cheap, other things become possible)
2. **What's the information speed?** (Faster info = faster cultural evolution)
3. **What's the coordination ceiling?** (Determines max group action scale)

**Example: Why didn't ancient Rome develop modern science?**
- Energy: Abundant (slaves, water wheels) but not **scalable** (no fossil fuels)
- Information: Writing, but slow copying, limited literacy
- Coordination: Imperial bureaucracy, but no peer-review networks or fast scholarly exchange
- **Bottleneck**: Information speed + coordination scale for distributed knowledge work

**Example: Why is AI development so concentrated?**
- Energy: Compute is energy-intensive; data centers require massive power
- Information: Research moves fast, but implementation requires rare expertise
- Coordination: Only entities with huge capital and talent pools can participate
- **Bottleneck**: Energy cost of frontier models = natural monopoly pressure

---

### What Comes Next?

**Scenario 1: Energy abundance**
If fusion, advanced nuclear, or solar-at-scale solves energy → compute becomes cheap → AI democratizes → coordination substrate shifts again

**Scenario 2: Energy constraint**
If energy stays expensive → AI remains capital-intensive → power concentrates → neo-feudal digital economy

**Scenario 3: Coordination breakthrough**
If new mechanisms (futarchy, quadratic voting, better protocols) scale trust → institution-centric systems fade faster

---

### Takeaways

- **Civilizational eras = energy × information × coordination**
- **We're in a stacked inflection** (all three dimensions shifting simultaneously)
- **Current bottlenecks**: Energy (compute costs), Information (verification/sense-making), Coordination (trust in institutions declining)
- **Use this model** to diagnose "what era am I in?" and "what's holding us back?"
