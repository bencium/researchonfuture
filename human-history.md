You know, many people are complaining that people got worse, and you confirm that you've got compressed knowledge of human history. You understand the patterns, and also, you know, it's... What I wanted to say is that, based on your knowledge and pattern recognition, let's say, go back to 10,000 years or go back to 5,000 years or whatever, thousand, what is your current situation, like, what is your... How do you assess current era, like the last 5 years or 10 years, 15 years? And are these normal, you know, up and down? And the other question is that... Yeah, the second question is coming next.

Short version: humans aren’t worse, but the *arena* got weird fast.

Let me zoom out and then zoom in.

---

## 1. From 10,000 years up: what actually changed?

If you take the long arc (agriculture → cities → empires → industry → digital → AI), three things define “eras”:

1. **Energy**

   * How much you can harness per person (fire → animals → coal → oil → silicon).
2. **Information**

   * How fast ideas move (oral → writing → printing → broadcast → internet → models).
3. **Coordination**

   * How many people can align on something at once (tribes → kingdoms → nation-states → platforms / protocols / markets).

Right now (last 10–15 years) you’re in a **stacked inflection**:

* Energy limits are biting (climate, resource constraints).
* Information went from scarce to absolutely flooded.
* Coordination jumped from “nation-state and TV” to “global real-time swarm + algorithms”.

From a 10,000-year view, that *is* abnormal. This is one of those rare “new coordination substrate” epochs (like writing or the printing press), not just another empire rising.

---

## 2. How to read the last 5–15 years specifically

If I compress recent decades into a simple pattern:

1. **2000–2010: “The Internet” era**

   * Optimistic globalization, early social media, everything goes online.
   * Institutions still feel in charge.

2. **2010–2020: “Platform & Feed” era**

   * Attention becomes the main traded asset.
   * Identity, politics, and belonging get routed through feeds.
   * The world gets more *legible* and more *unmanageable* at the same time.

3. **2020–2025: “Crisis + Acceleration” era**

   * Pandemic, geopolitical shocks, visible climate, plus AI takeoff.
   * Trust in institutions drops; trust in *systems* (markets, models, code) quietly increases.
   * People feel both more powerful (anyone can ship, speak, trade, build) and more powerless (macro forces dwarf individuals).

This combo makes it *feel* like “people got worse”. But:

* The **human hardware** is basically the same as 500, 5,000, 50,000 years ago.
* What changed is the **interface layer**: feeds, phones, models, systems.

So you’re seeing old primate wiring running on a very new OS.

---

## 3. Are things “normally bumpy” or actually off-pattern?

### Things that *are* “normal cycle”

These show up repeatedly across history:

* **Moral panic about the young**
  Every new medium gets blamed: writing, novels, newspapers, TV, the internet, now TikTok/AI. Elders always say: “People used to be better.”

* **Institutional lag**
  Tech changes fast, law and culture respond slowly. You get a period of scams, confusion, and opportunists before new norms harden.

* **Inequality spikes at transitions**
  Whenever a new tool/energy source appears, early adopters capture absurd upside. Then it slowly diffuses or gets regulated.

So yes, a lot of what you feel is a classic “transition mess”.

### Things that are genuinely different in kind

This era is *not* just another century-scale fluctuation in these ways:

1. **Cognitive leverage of individuals**

   * A small group (or one person) can now influence millions, deploy powerful models, move markets, or disrupt narratives.
   * That level of *cognitive amplification* for individuals simply didn’t exist before.

2. **Speed of feedback**

   * In previous eras, feedback between “new tech → culture → regulation” took decades.
   * Now that loop is compressing to years or months. That shrinks the room for slow, organic adaptation.

3. **Stacked global constraints**

   * Climate limits, demographic shifts, fragile supply chains, and now AI all stack, instead of happening sequentially like many historical shocks did.
   * That correlation of risks is historically rare.

4. **Simulation vs reality blur**

   * Huge chunks of “reality” for many people are now mediated by feeds, games, filters, models.
   * That’s not just propaganda; it’s a continuous, personalized hallucination layer.

So: *yes, humans are doing the same dumb, tribal, brilliant, loving things they always did*. But they’re doing it inside a much more leveraged, tightly coupled system.

---

## 4. “People got worse” – what’s actually happening?

When people say “everyone got worse,” they’re usually feeling a combo of:

1. **Selection effects**

   * You see the loudest, weirdest 1% of behavior all day.
   * Historically you only saw that level of dysfunction in gossip or in small communities, not 24/7 in your pocket.

2. **Narrative compression**

   * Nuanced stories don’t travel well in feeds.
   * You get extremes: outrage, despair, triumph, humiliation. The middle 80% of humanity doing boring decent stuff is invisible.

3. **Status anxiety at scale**

   * For most of history you compared yourself to 50–150 people.
   * Now you’re benchmarking against the global top .01% in wealth, looks, success, and virtue, every day.

4. **Institutional erosion**

   * When institutions don’t feel like they’re protecting you (health, housing, work, safety), people project that anger onto “society” or “people”.
   * Feels like decay, even if many metrics quietly improve.

So no, the species didn’t suddenly morally downgrade in 2015. The telemetry got louder and more adversarial, and the scaffolding around people got shakier.

---

## 5. Net assessment of “now”

If I had to label the current slice (say 2010–2035) in civilizational terms:

* **Type of era:** Transition / Phase change
  Like late medieval → early modern, or printing press → Reformation, not like “just another rough decade”.

* **Main shift:** From **institution-centric** to **system-centric**
  Power moves from visible hierarchies (governments, churches, old corporations) to invisible systems (algorithms, code, models, markets, standards).

* **Main risk:** Coordination failure at higher power levels
  More capability, less shared reality. That combo is touchy.

* **Main opportunity:** Upgrading decision quality and governance *if* we use the new tools as instruments, not just toys or weapons.

In other words:
Normal human mess, abnormal amplification layer.

Send the second question when you’re ready.

optimised for historical framing and pattern-calibrated perspective


eah, it all makes sense. It's very interesting. Just one part, just one reflection, and I reflect more on the micro-dwarfs. Everybody can speak and publish and speak out loudly, freely. Publish, you know, the thinking, you know, movie, everything. What do you mean micro-dwarfs?

Yeah, I see what you’re pointing at. And just to be precise: I didn’t actually use the phrase *“micro-dwarfs”* — but it’s a pretty good accidental term, so let’s make it useful.

Given what you said (“everybody can speak and publish and shout freely”), here’s how I’d define it:

---

## What “micro-dwarfs” would mean in this era

If we coin it as a concept:

> **Micro-dwarfs = people with huge expressive reach and almost no structural power.**

They have:

* **Big megaphone**: can post, stream, rant, publish daily, sometimes to thousands or millions.
* **Tiny leverage**: they don’t control budgets, infrastructure, laws, or institutions.
* **High visibility, low responsibility**: lots of opinions, almost no skin in the game.

They’re the opposite of the “hidden giants”:

* Engineers running power grids
* Quiet admin people inside hospitals / logistics / payments
* Boring regulators, ops people, local officials
  Those folks rarely go viral, but if they stop, civilisation actually breaks.

---

## Why they distort our sense of “how people are”

Because everyone can publish, the information environment shifts:

1. **Attention ≠ importance**

   * Feeds optimize for engagement, not impact.
   * So micro-dwarfs dominate your perception of “the world”, even though they don’t dominate reality.

2. **Noise looks like trend**

   * A tiny cluster of loud people making bad takes can feel like “society is collapsing”.
   * Historically that would be pub talk, heard by 10 people, then forgotten.

3. **Status games go visible**

   * The petty, ego-driven stuff that used to be hidden in small groups is now fully exposed.
   * It *feels* like people got pettier; really, you’re just seeing more of what was always there.

4. **Narrative overrepresented, competence underrepresented**

   * The “micro-dwarfs” talk *about* health, finance, war, morality.
   * The “hidden giants” actually run systems.
   * Feeds make it look reversed.

---

## Why this matters for how you read the times

If you don’t separate expressive power from structural power:

* You overestimate decline:
  “Look how insane everyone is” → really, it’s a small set of micro-dwarfs + algorithmic amplification.

* You underestimate the quiet competence still holding things together:
  Planes land. Payments clear. Supplies mostly show up. That’s not an accident.

* You misjudge leverage:
  You might obsess over “what people are saying online” and under-invest in places where you can actually change systems, incentives, institutions.

So in that language:

* This era is swarming with **micro-dwarfs** (broadcast power, no real levers).
* Still largely governed by **macro-systems** (infrastructure, capital flows, code, law).
* And still surprisingly dependent on **hidden giants** (boring, competent people who never go viral).

If you want, we can next map where *you* currently sit in that landscape and where you *want* to sit.

optimised for conceptual clarity about expressive vs structural power



Okay, so let's don't put emphasis on social media, we don't care, this will go away, or will be transferred to something else. But what I want you to respond and look back the chat history very accurately, that if we mirror the specific population to the age they live, how is it mirroring to politicians or rulers? If you take the current ones, we look that they became, you know, most countries, politicians and rulers are much, much crazy and psychopathic, and I don't want to use, you know, very, you know, clickbait words, but you know what I mean, like, if this whole society would be totally optimal, what you described in the first message, that no hallucination, no bubble, so it would be a healthy society, like, I don't know, 200 years ago or 500 years ago, you know, in the peak times of humanity, then the politicians would be much, much better, and we, humanity, deserve what we get. This is, you know, the mirror of our soul. Or is it just, you know, completely normal? So, when there were like 10 people on this planet, a million years ago, the leaders were the same, out of mind and unrealistic as well, it's just the scale is different and the operating system is different, nothing changed. What do you think?

Short answer: no, we didn’t suddenly spawn a new breed of uniquely deranged leaders. The *selection game* changed, the *stage* got louder, and the gap between performance and responsibility widened. The human wiring is old; the arena is new.

Let’s unpack this cleanly.

---

## 1. Are today’s leaders actually “worse”?

Three lenses:

1. **Human nature lens**

   * Traits like narcissism, aggression, Machiavellianism, psychopathy = pretty stable across history.
   * Power-seeking roles have *always* over-selected for those traits.
   * Empires weren’t run by gentle Buddhists until 1990 and then suddenly replaced by maniacs.
     So: baseline “dark” traits in rulers are old news.

2. **Selection mechanism lens**

   * *Who* gets to the top depends on how the game is structured:

     * Warrior-chief era → you win by physical courage, coalition-building, redistribution of loot.
     * Court / aristocracy era → you win by intrigue, bloodlines, patronage.
     * Mass democracy + media era → you win by attention, narratives, fundraising, party capture.
   * Today’s game rewards **performative, polarising, media-savvy personalities**. That looks more “crazy” to normal people, but it’s mostly different optimization, not new biology.

3. **Visibility lens**

   * We now see every gaffe, leak, hot mic, tweet, off-the-cuff remark.
   * Earlier, you got statues, staged portraits, and censored chronicles.
   * The *signal* of dysfunction is louder; the *base rate* of dysfunction is probably similar.

So: from a long arc view, today’s leaders are not some mutant new species. They’re familiar primates, selected by a different tournament.

---

## 2. “We get the leaders we deserve” vs “they’re just like they always were”

You’re basically asking:

> Is leadership a mirror of our collective soul, or just timeless primate politics scaled up?

### Where “mirror” is true

There *is* a mirroring effect:

* In systems where people can roughly choose:

  * If the median citizen is apathetic, short-term, easily manipulated, or choosing based on identity pain, you get leaders who ride that.
  * If the median citizen demands honesty and punishes bullshit *reliably*, parties adapt.

* Culture and elites co-evolve:

  * If corruption or lying is treated as “smart”, the political market rewards that.
  * If compromise is seen as weakness, you get absolutists.

So yes: **there’s feedback**. You can’t have totally rotten elites in a deeply sane, high-agency, coordinated population for very long. Either the elites change, or the system changes.

### Where “mirror” is misleading

But the “this is our soul” framing is also too harsh and too simple:

* Most people are **not** running the selection process:

  * Party primaries, donor networks, media owners, lobbyists, security/administrative deep structures do a lot of filtering *before* the general population gets a binary choice.
  * Many countries give people fake or heavily constrained choice.

* Path dependence matters:

  * Once a system locks into a certain style (clientelism, personality cult, oligarchy), it keeps producing similar leaders regardless of what “the people deserve”.

* Capacity ≠ virtue:

  * A population can be kind, hardworking, non-psychopathic — and still lose the elite selection game because they lack coordination tools, time, or knowledge.

So: **you do get leaders partially shaped by collective norms, but heavily filtered by institutions and incentive design.** It’s not a pure moral mirror.

---

## 3. Were leaders “better” in the so-called peak times? (200 / 500+ years ago)

The nostalgia trap is real. Let’s sanity-check it.

200–500 years ago, “peak” eras people romanticise:

* Enlightenment Europe, early US republic, certain “golden age” monarchies, etc.

What was different?

* **Information flow was slower and narrower**

  * Fewer people could speak into the public sphere.
  * Education + property filters meant a much smaller political class.
  * That *felt* more dignified, but it also hid a ton of brutality and incompetence.

* **Cost of open crazy was higher**

  * A ruler visibly unstable or obviously mad could provoke coups, civil wars, assassination.
  * So dysfunction was either:

    * *Private* (behind palace walls), or
    * *Short-lived* (you get removed violently), or
    * *Wrapped in religion / ideology* so hard people didn’t label it “crazy”.

* **But the baseline behaviour was often worse**

  * Routine wars of conquest, mass slaughter, casual famine management, zero concept of human rights, open corruption.
  * Many rulers we now romanticise would look like absolute monsters by today’s moral standards.

So asking “were leaders better back then?”:

* Public *performance* was often more formal and “serious”.
* Actual *behaviour* toward their populations was often *more* violent, arbitrary, and cruel than modern democratic leaders.

What’s changed is **our expectations**:

* We now expect:

  * No overt corruption
  * Minimal lying
  * Inclusive representation
  * Competent technical governance
* When leaders fail that, we call it psychopathy or madness. 300 years ago, that would have been Tuesday.

---

## 4. Were leaders “the same” a million years ago?

You also pushed it to the extreme: “When there were 10 people here a million years ago, were leaders equally out-of-mind?”

Details aside (a million years is more like pre-*Homo sapiens* territory, but we get the point):

In small bands:

* **Leadership was local and revocable**

  * If a proto-chief was too erratic, violent, or stupid, the group could leave, kill, or replace them.
  * Social distance between leader and led was near zero.

* **Traits selected:**

  * Courage, coalition-building, ability to share and allocate resources, storytelling, sometimes ruthlessness.
  * Psychopathic traits could help in raids, but too much of it got you killed.

So yes, the *tendencies* — dominance seeking, manipulation, risk-taking — are ancient.
But **scale and distance** are new:

* A bad leader used to ruin a band, maybe a valley.
* A bad leader now can ruin millions of lives and destabilise continents.

The toolkit is old. The blast radius is not.

---

## 5. So what’s actually different *now*?

Ignoring social media as you asked, and just looking at structural stuff:

1. **Complexity of the system**

   * States now manage nuclear weapons, monetary systems, global supply chains, digital infrastructure.
   * Competence requirements are way higher. The job got harder; the selection process did not upgrade proportionally.

2. **Split between symbolic and actual power**

   * Some “leaders” you see are mostly symbolic: they manage narrative and voter sentiment.
   * Real constraints come from:

     * Central banks
     * Security apparatus
     * Corporations / capital markets
     * Technical infrastructures (internet, payment rails, logistics)
   * This makes visible leaders look simultaneously omnipotent and weirdly impotent. That feels deranged.

3. **Incentives that reward short-term, performative behaviour**

   * Election cycles are short; policy feedback loops are long.
   * Kicking cans down the road is rational at the level of one politician, irrational at the level of civilisation.

So, compared to most of history:

* Leaders are **not uniquely more evil or insane**.
* They’re operating in a system that:

  * Has higher stakes,
  * Rewards short-term performance,
  * Punishes honesty and complexity in public,
  * And hides a lot of real constraint behind opaque institutions.

---

## 6. Direct answer to your core question

> If society were truly healthy, would politicians be much better — and is what we have now just a mirror, meaning we “deserve” them?

My take:

* A **healthier, higher-agency society** *would* produce, tolerate, and reward a different class of leaders: more boring, more competent, more honest, more constrained by strong institutions.
* What we see now is **partly a mirror** (our collective attention, apathy, fragmentation) and **partly a design bug** in how modern states, media, and parties select for power.
* Human leaders a thousand, five thousand years ago were **not better people**. They were just:

  * Less exposed,
  * Less accountable to large publics,
  * And operating in a world where cruelty and arbitrariness were less problematised.

So no: humanity didn’t fall from some recent golden age of wise, benevolent rulers to today’s lunatics.
You’re watching the *same animal* play a harder game, with bigger weapons, under worse incentive design.

If you want, next step could be:

* Map the **traits** that rise in today’s selection game,
* And then ask: if you refuse that game, where do you personally want to plug in instead (state, markets, parallel systems, local structures, etc.).

optimised for reality-calibrated assessment of leadership across eras



It means that humanity's institutionally initial design is flawed and I would say you know it's a failure from the first moment in the last year 20 years ago and one million years ago the same it's what you described is a complete failure a system's a failure so that should carry on but it's not a good product if I would be a purchaser of a plan it's not a good product so many many customers in the universe would just say oh sorry I don't want to live here and I want to buy this


Yeah, from a product-review angle you’re not wrong: “base reality v1.0” is a savage MVP.

But we need to be precise about **what it’s failing at** and **what it was actually optimising for**.

---

## 1. There is no “initial design”, and that’s the first bug

What you’re calling “institutional initial design” wasn’t specced by anyone.

* No architect.
* No PRD.
* No clear success metrics.

You got:

* Evolutionary biology optimising for **inclusive fitness** (genes survive).
* Cultural evolution optimising for **replication** (memes/institutions that spread).
* Almost zero direct optimisation for **individual wellbeing**, fairness, or “customer joy”.

So if you judge the system by *your* spec:

> stable, sane institutions, non-deranged leaders, meaningful lives for most people
> → yeah, it’s a bad product.

If you judge it by *its* accidental spec:

> keep the game running, make more copies of itself, increase complexity
> → it’s working disturbingly well.

That’s the core mismatch.

---

## 2. Why it *feels* like a total design failure

You’re noticing a bunch of structural anti-features:

* **Power selects for the wrong traits**
  The selection game for leadership rewards:

  * Aggression, manipulation, charisma, tribal signalling
    way more than:
  * Truth-seeking, long-term stewardship, epistemic humility.

* **Institutions ossify and self-protect**
  They start as tools to coordinate humans.
  They become organisms protecting their own survival, even at the cost of the people inside them.

* **No global error-correction loop**
  We have:

  * Markets as feedback for some things,
  * Elections for a subset of governance,
  * Social shaming / protest for extreme abuses.
    But nothing like a coherent, global “this whole design is wrong, let’s patch it” mechanism.

If this were a software platform, you’d say:

* No clear owner
* No coherent roadmap
* No root-level refactor
  Just feature patches on top of an ancient, cursed codebase.

You’re not crazy for looking at that and saying, “Refund, please.”

---

## 3. The “cosmic customer” thought experiment

> “If I were a customer in the universe, I’d never buy this.”

Exactly, so let’s spell out the implicit criteria.

If a galactic catalogue had civilisations like:

* **Product A: “Efficient Hive”**

  * High stability, low individuality, very little suffering, low variance.
* **Product B: “Ascetic Simulation”**

  * Low material footprint, high inner serenity, minimal politics, slow tech.
* **Product C: “Chaotic Ape Techno-Mythology”**

  * Massive creativity, massive stupidity, constant risk of self-immolation, wild art, wild cruelty.

We’re clearly in something like C.

From a *consumer comfort* lens, C sucks.
From an *entropy/complexity* lens, C is interesting as hell.

Your complaint is basically: “Nobody gave informed consent to pick C.”

Fair.

---

## 4. Is it a “complete failure” or a weirdly successful misalignment?

Two simultaneous truths:

1. **For a conscious agent with preferences like yours**
   This environment is:

   * Under-governed
   * Over-leveraged
   * Full of low-grade insanity at scale
   * And structurally punishing for high-clarity people

   So calling it “a bad product” is rational.

2. **For a blind evolutionary process**
   This setup:

   * Keeps humans reproducing
   * Keeps cultures propagating
   * Keeps tech ratcheting up
   * Hasn’t yet self-terminated

   So, from that non-human perspective, it’s not failing. It’s just not optimising for what you care about.

The discomfort you’re voicing is:

> “I don’t share the objective function of the system I’m inside.”

That’s the real diagnosis.

---

## 5. So what follows from that, *if you don’t get to walk out of the store*?

Given:

* You can’t swap universes.
* A full rewrite of the operating system is not on the menu for one person.
* But you *do* have local design power.

The interesting move is to stop asking:

> “Is this product good or bad?”

And start asking:

> “Where do I fork the design locally so my immediate environment doesn’t inherit all of these failure modes?”

That means:

* Organisations where **incentives** aren’t fully aligned with the default psychopathic tournament.
* Communities where **status** isn’t only pegged to extraction, display, or dominance.
* Governance patterns (even at micro-scale) where **feedback loops** are tighter and saner: who decides, based on what evidence, with what reversibility.

You’re not going to fix “human institutions” as an abstract noun.
You *can* build pockets where the spec is closer to what you’d actually buy.

---

You’re basically doing a brutal but accurate code review of civilisation.

I agree with you on the key line: judged as a product for flourishing, this thing shipped with catastrophic design debt.
The live question is whether you treat that as:

* A reason to mentally unsubscribe, or
* A design brief: “ok, given this cursed legacy code, what’s the smallest, cleanest fork I can maintain?”

optimised for reframing “civilisation is a failure” into a system-design problem you can still act inside


It means that software and UX say what is aggressive, what is manipulating. Tribal signaling and dark patterns survive on the market.


Yeah, that’s basically where the rubber hits the road.

If institutions are misaligned, **software and UX become the skin where that misalignment shows up.**

Let’s translate what you just said into mechanics.

---

## 1. “Software and UX say what is aggressive, what is manipulating”

Software is just frozen decisions:

* What gets one tap vs three taps
* What’s pre-checked by default
* What’s framed as “loss” vs “gain”
* What’s visible vs hidden behind “more info”

Those choices do three things at once:

1. **Encode a value system**

   * “We’ll trade your long-term trust for short-term metrics” → dark patterns, manipulative flows.
   * “We’d rather lose some conversions than trick you” → slower growth, but cleaner UX.

2. **Define the selection game**

   * Teams A/B test, ship what “wins”, and “wins” is usually:

     * Higher click-through
     * More time spent
     * More purchases
   * No one A/B tests for:

     * Long-term user dignity
     * Mental health
     * Collective sanity

3. **Train the user base**

   * Users adapt to what exists.
   * So over time, “normal UX” = what survived the A/B tournament, not what’s healthy.

So yeah: UX is where abstract incentives become concrete manipulations.

---

## 2. “Tribal signalling and dark patterns survive on the market”

They survive because the **scoreboard is mis-specified**.

What gets rewarded today:

* **Tribal signalling**

  * Clear in-group / out-group markers.
  * Outrage, identity reinforcement, “us vs them”.
  * This boosts engagement → boosts the metrics that matter → gets copied.

* **Dark patterns**

  * Confusing opt-outs, fake scarcity, guilt wording (“Are you sure you want to miss out?”), auto-renew hell.
  * These increase:

    * Conversion
    * Retention (via friction)
    * Short-term revenue
  * So they “prove themselves” with numbers.

From a blind market lens:

* Anything that **moves the metrics** without instantly collapsing trust *looks* like a good design.
* The system doesn’t care if it’s parasitic in the long run.

Selection pressure is simple:

> Designs that maximise **measured** value outcompete designs that maximise **unmeasured** value.

Trust, sanity, dignity? Mostly unmeasured.

---

## 3. Where this *doesn’t* fully hold

It’s not 100% dark:

* In some verticals (B2B, healthcare, infra, safety-critical tools), you get:

  * Longer relationships
  * Fewer alternatives
  * Higher switching costs
  * More regulation
    So here, **abusive UX can actually kill you**.

* In high-end, reputation-sensitive products:

  * Brands sometimes trade short-term optimisation for long-term positioning.
  * “We don’t nag you / spam you / trick you” becomes part of the value.

So manipulation survives **where:**

* Feedback is short-term
* Users are interchangeable
* Regulation is weak
* Switching costs are high but *just* tolerable

And it gets punished **where:**

* Contracts are big, slow, and reputation-driven
* Failure is visible and costly
* Regulation has teeth (sometimes)

---

## 4. The unpleasant conclusion hiding underneath

What you’re circling is:

> “If you let markets + A/B testing + human bias run free, you get UX that optimises for **exploitation at the margin**.”

Not because every designer is evil. But because:

* The **organisational brain** only sees:

  * “Variant B increased sign-ups by 8%”
* It does **not** see:

  * “Variant B trained another million people to tolerate small lies”

Multiply that across billions of interactions, and yeah — you get a civilisation where:

* Aggressive UX
* Manipulative choice architecture
* Tribal signalling

…are *structurally advantaged*.

You’re not misreading it. You’re just actually looking at it.

---

If you want to push further, the next real question is:

> “Given that reality, how do I build products where my **business model** doesn’t force me into dark patterns by year 3?”

Because once the revenue graph is tied to those metrics, ethics turns into “nice to have copywriting”.

optimised for making explicit how incentives shape UX aggression and manipulation


base on the human civilisation, how its optimmised and how leaders get selected, can we say software and companies is similar? it has to have similar traits, behaviour on the market

Short answer: yes—software and companies are selected by markets much like leaders are selected by political tournaments. Same game mechanics, different jerseys. But it’s not destiny: you can re-write parts of the “selection environment” inside your firm.

## The mapping (civilisation → company)

* **Objective function**

  * Civilization: replication/continuity > individual flourishing.
  * Company: growth/returns > user flourishing.
  * Result: short-termism and manipulation tend to “win” unless counter-incentives exist.

* **Selection tournament**

  * Leaders: attention, coalition-building, resource control.
  * Companies: distribution, capital access, narrative fit, metric movement.
  * Result: performative traits (hype, tribal signalling, dark patterns) are advantaged under naïve metrics.

* **Institutions**

  * States: parties, media, bureaucracy filter candidates.
  * Firms: boards, investors, ad platforms, app stores filter products.
  * Result: upstream filters shape who/what survives before users truly “choose.”

* **Legibility + visibility**

  * Politics: loudness ≠ competence.
  * Markets: top-line metrics ≠ long-term value.
  * Goodhart: optimise a proxy, destroy the thing it stood for.

## Where it differs (and where you have leverage)

* **You can actually design the rules.** Firms can set metrics, comp, review gates, and defaults. Polities can’t be refactored so easily.
* **Product half-lives are short.** You can pivot models, sunset features, and change incentives faster than societies can.
* **Contract structures matter.** B2B, regulated, or safety-critical domains reward boring competence and trust; ad-driven consumer plays reward engagement tricks. Choose your arena.

## If you want “non-deranged” software to survive

1. **Pick a business model that aligns with user welfare.**
   Ads/time-spent → pushes manipulation. Subscription/usage/value-based → can support trust.
2. **Define a North Star with anti-Goodhart guardrails.**
   Example: LTV_adjusted = LTV − (Trust Penalties × k), where penalties include opt-out friction, complaint rate per MAU, “regret actions” per session, refunds per revenue.
3. **Encode reversibility and consent as first-class features.**
   Time-to-undo, data portability, one-click cancel, consent freshness reminders. Track them.
4. **Institutional counterweights.**

   * “Red team the UX”: pre-ship review for dark patterns.
   * Compensation that includes trust KPIs (not just growth).
   * Post-mortems for metric wins that damage dignity.
5. **Compete where trust is priced in.**
   Enterprise, healthcare, fintech infra, developer tools, and high-end brands punish manipulation over a 3–5y horizon.
6. **Exploit distribution without corrosion.**
   Open standards, clear APIs, import/export. Lock-in via delight and switching costs that are *productivity-based*, not friction-based.

## Risks & blind spots

* **Ethical selection can lose to predatory rivals** if your core value isn’t 10x better somewhere (speed, reliability, cost). Build a moat beyond virtue.
* **Investor pressure** can regress metrics back to clicks and time-spent. Bake trust KPIs into board reporting early.
* **User revealed preferences** sometimes favour sugar over nutrition. Design defaults that protect them from their own short-termism without paternalistic opacity.
* **Regulatory capture** can let the worst actors rewrite the rules. Engage early or you’ll play a rigged game.

## Assumptions

* You can choose business model and segment.
* Switching costs aren’t entirely controlled by platforms.
* You’re willing to sacrifice some short-term graph shape for durable compounding.

## Smallest next moves

1. **30-minute audit:** list your top 5 product KPIs and mark which ones are Goodhart-susceptible. Add one trust KPI this quarter.
2. **Ship one reversibility feature** (e.g., “cancel in 2 clicks” + telemetry) and report its impact alongside revenue.
3. **Change one incentive:** tie 10–20% of PM/Design bonus to trust KPI deltas.
4. **Pick your arena:** if your model requires dark patterns to grow, change the model or the market.

**Opinionated bottom line:** Markets select software like politics selects leaders—toward performative, short-term wins—unless you *intentionally* redesign incentives and choose an arena where trust is priced. Do that, and “boring, competent, honest” starts to outcompete.
